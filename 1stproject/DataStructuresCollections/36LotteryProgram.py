# Lottery Program
# Using "random"
# Let's write a simple function that will help organise lotteries. The function will generate a list of random numbers
# (to simulate lottery tickets), and it will also choose one number from the generated list (to simulate the
# winning ticket).
#
# Write a function named generate_tickets that will accept two integer arguments: ticket_count and max_number. The
# function should return a tuple with exactly two elements:
#
# first element: a list of random unique integer numbers in the range from 0 (inclusive) to max_number (exclusive); the
# number of elements is provided in the ticket_count argument
#
# second element: one random element from the generated list of numbers
#
# Calling generate_tickets(5, 10) should generate 5 random unique integers in the range from 0 (inclusive) to 10
# (exclusive). An example return value for this invocation could be:
#
# ([2, 8, 9, 3, 0], 8)
#
# In this case, the random numbers are: 2, 8, 9, 3, 0. The winning number is 8.
#
# Note: You can assume that the arguments of the function are always correct (i.e. you always get two correct integers
# as the input arguments).

    unique_selection = []
    for i in range(max_number):
        ticket_list.append(i)
    unique_selection = random.sample(ticket_list, ticket_count)
    ticket_tuple = (unique_selection, random.choice(unique_selection))
    return ticket_tuple
    pass
